    "A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed on a computer system. The data in a database can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured, and it can be manipulated in a variety of ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems. SQL databases are relational databases, which means that the data is stored in tables with fixed schemas, and the relationships between the tables are defined by primary and foreign keys. SQL databases are ideal for applications that require complex queries, and they are often used for financial and accounting systems, human resources management, and e-commerce.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that store data in a variety of formats, including key-value, document, and graph formats. NoSQL databases are designed for applications that require scalability and flexibility, and they are often used for web applications, real-time analytics, and social media platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational and use SQL as the primary language for querying data, while NoSQL databases are non-relational and use a variety of data models and languages.\n",
